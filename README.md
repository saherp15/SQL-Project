SQL Projects
This repository contains a collection of SQL projects that demonstrate various database management tasks, data analysis, and reporting using SQL. Each project is organized in a separate folder and includes SQL scripts, sample data, and documentation.

Projects
The following SQL projects are included in this repository:

Project 1: [Nashville House Data Cleaning Project](https://github.com/saherp15/SQL-Project/blob/main/projects.sql)


Description: This project involves cleaning and preparing a dataset of Nashville housing data for analysis. The dataset contains information about houses in Nashville, including attributes such as location, size, price, and condition. The project includes tasks such as handling missing values, correcting data inconsistencies, and transforming data as needed for analysis. The cleaned dataset is stored in a cleaned_data.csv file.

Technologies:  SQL server

Project 2:[Music store](https://github.com/saherp15/SQL-Project/blob/main/music.sql)
Description: The project likely involves analyzing data from a music store database using SQL queries. It may involve tasks such as retrieving and filtering data, performing calculations and aggregations, joining and combining tables, and generating reports or insights to gain meaningful information from the data. The project may focus on various aspects of music store data, such as sales, customers, products, orders, and transactions, and may involve exploring trends, patterns, and relationships in the data to derive actionable insights.

Install a compatible database management system (DBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or any other DBMS supported by the projects.
Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone or by downloading the ZIP file.
Navigate to the project folder that you want to run.
Follow the project-specific instructions in the README file of each project folder for setting up the database, loading sample data, and running the SQL scripts.
Usage
Each project folder contains its own README file with detailed instructions on how to use the SQL scripts and sample data to run the project. Generally, you can use a database client or command-line interface (CLI) to connect to the database, run the SQL scripts, and execute SQL queries to perform various tasks or generate reports.
